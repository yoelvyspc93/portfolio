# Developer Workflow

## Tooling
- Node is pinned via Volta. Use Node `22.13.1` (see `volta` in [package.json](mdc:package.json)). Package manager: Yarn.

## Common scripts
- `yarn dev` – start local development
- `yarn build` – production build (static export)
- `yarn start` – serve production build
- `yarn lint` / `yarn lint:fix` – lint TypeScript and TSX under `src/`
- `yarn format` – Prettier write across the repo
- `yarn audit:security` – check vulnerabilities

## Lint & Format before commit
- Ensure a clean lint run and formatting before pushing. Lint errors fail CI expectations.

## Commits
- Use Conventional Commits in English. Examples:
  - `feat: add projects carousel to home header`
  - `fix: correct CustomImage basePath handling on production`
  - `refactor: extract navigation helpers`
  - `chore: update dependencies`
  - `docs: add architecture rules`

## Branches
- Prefer descriptive branches, e.g., `feat/home-header-carousel`, `fix/a11y-focus-styles`.
