# Performance and Optimization

- **Loading and Resource Optimization:**
  - Use the `next/image` component with attributes like `priority`, `sizes`, and `loading="lazy"`.
  - Dynamically import large components to reduce initial load time.
  - Prefetch routes with `<Link prefetch />` in Next.js.

- **Animation Resource Management:**
  - Optimize GSAP usage by avoiding unnecessary animations that consume resources.
  - Monitor and minimize background memory usage.
