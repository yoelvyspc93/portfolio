# Performance

## Static export & base path

- The app is statically exported with a production base path `/` (see [next.config.ts](mdc:next.config.ts)).
- Prefer build-time data. Avoid runtime fetches on the client.

## Images

- Use [CustomImage](mdc:src/components/common/CustomImage/index.tsx) for all images to respect `basePath` and enable blur placeholders.
- Only set `priority` for a single LCP image (e.g., hero in the header). Otherwise, let images load lazily.

## Animations

- Use `gsap` thoughtfully. Honor reduced motion using a hook such as `usePrefersReducedMotion` if/when present.
- Keep animations off the main thread when possible; prefer transforms and opacity.

## Bundling

- Avoid unnecessary client components; keep logic server-side by default.
- Dynamically import heavy/rarely used components (e.g., carousels) with `next/dynamic`.
- Memoize expensive subtrees and avoid passing new inline objects/functions as props when they cause re-renders.

## Styles

- Scope styles with SCSS Modules. Avoid overly deep selectors; prefer small, composable classes.
